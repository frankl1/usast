# Explainable Classification of Uncertain Astronomical Time Series

This repository contains the source code and results of our work on the effective classification of uncertain astronomical time series with explainability in mind. We propose the Uncertain Scalable and Accurate Subsequence Transform (uSAST), derived from both the Uncertain Shapelet Transform and the Scalable and Accurate Subsequence Transform to accurately classify the PLAsTiCC astronomical uncertain time series dataset without using techniques such as data augmentation and data oversampling despite the fact that dataset contains 14 unbalance classes. Furthermore, uSAST explainability allows astrophysicists to understand the method and to build a subsequence profile for each class. 

## Repository content
- [plasticc_train_meta.csv](plasticc_train_meta.csv): This file contents the metadata of the PLAsTiCC dataset. The training data should downloaded [here](https://drive.uca.fr/f/f0741be3fb77402f8e82/).
- [plasticc-to-arff.ipynb](plasticc-to-arff.ipynb): This notebook is used to format the plasticc dataset to arff file and create train and test splits.
- [plasticc_train_test_split.csv](plasticc_train_test_split.csv): This file is generated by the notebook [plasticc-to-arff.ipynb](plasticc-to-arff.ipynb) and specifies the split and the index of each object in the arff files.
- [experiment_plasticc_u.py](experiment_plasticc_u.py): This is the python script used to run the experiment.
- The `sast` folder contents the implementations of SAST+ and uSAST+ algorithms
- [result-plasticc-paper.ipynb](result-plasticc-paper.ipynb): This is the notebook used to analyze the results of the experiment and format them for the paper.
